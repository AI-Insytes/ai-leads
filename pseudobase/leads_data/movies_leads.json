Sounds like the perfect opportunity to catch up on all those recent releases I haven‚Äôt had time to see, right?Because it turns out, I couldn‚Äôt sit through more than 5 minutes of a lot of said movies and ended up simply rewatching older films that I already knew I enjoyed. And my goodness this made me realise just how different movies have become in the last fifteen years or so. Now, this of course isn‚Äôt to say that all modern movies are bad or that everything produced in the past was a banger (#notall) BUT I will say that there was a discernible difference that kept coming up in everything I watched.Older films, even action flicks, just seemed to care more about having human relationships at their heart. No matter whether it was about terrorists at a Christmas party or a quest for the Holy Grail, these films made the conflict centre on family, friendship and love. Granted, sometimes this was done in a flawed way (*cough* Ocean‚Äôs Eleven *cough cough*). The central themes weren‚Äôt so concerned with subverting an existing narrative or grand venture in saving the world. No, they were simply personal stories of people pushed to their limits.",

I myself am not a boy but I am a great lover of boy movies, so you can imagine the ways I‚Äôve struggled over the years with my appreciation of them and what it says about me. Here, I‚Äôll attempt to reckon with it all by unpacking what makes a boy movie a boy movie, the specific ways movies are marketed toward men, what it is about boy movies that appeals (or doesn‚Äôt) to the rest of us, and more. Sometimes I welcome guests, sometimes I have contributors, sometimes I do themed months, and sometimes, when I‚Äôm in a silly mood, I write about girl movies. Mostly I‚Äôm just trying to have fun and eventually sell out to a major corporation in order to achieve my ultimate end goal of early retirement. Okay, sure, but who are you?Well, like I said, I‚Äôm Allison Picurro. I‚Äôm a writer, currently at TV Guide. I have bylines at Decider and IndieWire, and I used to work at HBO.

They are just releasing about 2 to 3 holiday-themed, and the titles don‚Äôt sound like something I would enjoy, so luckily, I do have a plan b. The movies I‚Äôm mentioning today can be found on YouTube, which I think is the most available platform worldwide.Another option can be a site called CTV; it is a Canadian site that you can access if you are in Canada or, like me, have a VPN. I looked, and there are about 79 titles available, many of which are free. Just a heads-up, it does have ads while you watch. The ones I‚Äôm watching right now are the ones that say to leave the site soon underneath. Last weekend, I saw the Hotel for the Holidays, which came out last year. I think the best actress in that movie is Madelaine Petsch, who played Georgia (the main character). Currently, it isn‚Äôt on YouTube.

A good movie makes the audience feel like they‚Äôve journeyed with the characters. So if you feel a sting on your left cheek, it‚Äôs just because of great writing on my part.Life is just like a movie, the characters come and go as seen in the movies. But there is a difference, movies last only three hours. Ours last a little too long and there are no end credit scenes. Life is like a camera, focus on what‚Äôs important and capture the good times. You‚Äôll be able to delude yourself. Life is like a movie. Write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending. The older I get, the more I realize that not everything always goes as planned, but this is not some fairy tale movie. This is real life and things happen.

I did my Winter TBR last week, so thought about what to do this week. I had Covid last week and was housebound, so watched a lot of Christmas/Holiday movies, so that is how I came up with my alternative list. These are not in any particular order. I was going to attach a trailer to each, but it became way too huge, so I deleted them.White Christmas: 1954 ‚Äß Musical/Comedy starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera LynnThe Christmas Carol: 1951 version starring Alastair Sim, although I also enjoy the 1999 version starring Patrick StewartCharlie Brown Christmas: 1965, the first TV special based on the comic strip Peanuts, Christian Flavour with Linus reciting the Luke version of Christ‚Äôs birthMiracle on 34th Street: 1947, starring Maureen O‚ÄôHara, John Payne, Natalie Wood, and Edmund Gwenn. Originally in black and white, it has been colorized. The 1994 version is also good, but I love the originalThe Man Who Invented Christmas: 2017, The journey that led to Charles Dickens‚Äô creation of ‚ÄúA Christmas Carol‚Äù  I just watched this for the first time and absolutely loved it. I know this will be one I will watch againNovember Christmas: 2010, A brave young girl‚Äôs battle against cancer has an effect on the people around her. Hallmark MovieThe Christmas Shoes: 2002, A young boy tries to get a pair of Christmas shoes for his dying mother, while a lawyer tries to deal with the break-up of his marriage. Based on a book by Donna VanLiere and song by NewSong (It always makes me cry)National Lampoon‚Äôs Christmas Vacation: 1989, This one just makes me laughHow The Grinch Stole Christmas: Although the 1966 cartoon was the first one I watched and loved, the 2000 version starring Jim Carey is the one I now watch and loveIt‚Äôs A Wonderful Life: 1946 Fantasy starring Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, & Henry Travers as Clarence.

Most of you know how that game turned out (sorry John and Staci). Anyway, we still had a fantastic time seeing him and his girlfriend and enjoyed Christmas lights, a little shopping (there was a chocolate shop just up the street!), and great food.I thought I‚Äôd share our favorite Christmas movies with you today. There are plenty out there, and our choices may tell you a little about our personalities. When Hubby and I were first married, he was shocked I‚Äôd never seen It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life. Nearly thirty-six years later, I‚Äôve seen it that many times. Our sons were never crazy about it, but still watched with us. The Family Man with Nicolas Cage is kind of a humorous spin on that movie, but it‚Äôs also a favorite. Christmas Vacation is a must, and we can probably quote the whole movie. Shi#$er‚Äôs full! It‚Äôs not in the picture, but The Family Stone has also become a regular on the viewing schedule. You can‚Äôt go wrong with Craig T. Nelson, and I‚Äôm a sucker for a dysfunctional family movie.With these next two, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend letting the younger viewers in your house watch. We‚Äôre big Ryan Reynolds fans and discovered Just Friends years ago. If you‚Äôre familiar with his movies, the occasional crude humor remarks won‚Äôt surprise you ‚Äì they‚Äôre expected. I still snort over some of the scenes. Why Him? is also set during Christmas. Rotten Tomatoes only rated it 39%, but we like it. Again, expect the occasional crude humor.",
