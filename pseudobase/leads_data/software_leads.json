Especially since the rest of the day was given over to downloading software for the new computer. This is a nice way to wrap things up. Happy birthday, mom!-- JS",

Back in the day, I used to find an uplifting story or something I wanted to chat about and go with it. For some reason, I have become stricter with what I write and how I do it, but I’m hoping to shift that today. I googled uplifting stories, and an article about elephants piqued my interest. Before I get into the account, here is a fun fact about me: elephants are one of my favourite animals for their sense of herd and familyEverything started with two software engineers who decided to put their efforts into wildlife conservation instead of going into the typical tech route. The two young guys from India got to reach the gap between crime and justice by introducing 21st-century apps and tools into the already-used system. This way allows rangers to track and analyze the patterns that criminals and traffickers have. This new technology also helps with evidence and faster process once the cases go to court.On paper, based solely on memory, records were kept, which could be easily damaged or lost, which might cause criminals to go unpunished. Allen Shaji, co-founder of Leopard Tech Labs, with the help of the Wildlife Trust of India, was able to develop HAWK, standing for Hostile Activity Watch Kernel; the program is supported by the forest department of Kerala in a statement that he gave the media. He said that HAWK also has access to massive datasets assembled by the IUCN, the world’s largest wildlife conservation organization.",

Why should I pay for a subscription to software to do something so basic? Why should I pay for something when I don’t have to? These are questions that many people who have been indoctrinated into the Microsoft brand don’t seem to ask as often as they should. However, I seem to have outgrown LibreOffice for the book and did a lot of research on it. There’s a lot to keep track of even with a simple blog post here on KnowProSE.com, much less a science fiction/fantasy novel. I tried a few and I settled on Scrivener because where I have outgrown LibreOffice in this regard, I feel like I can grow into Scrivener. I bought it last night, and am already finding it a step up from what I’ve been doing. I have been writing long enough now to know what I need to write. Before, this was not the case and LibreOffice worked well not just for writing as I was, but for allowing to find out what best I needed personally. The price of LibreOffice is also impossible to beat, and I still have it for the office suite. ",

        "context": "Newsletter Name: Software Design: Tidy First? Newsletter Description: Helping Geeks Feel Safe in the WorldI’m Kent Beck & my mission is to help geeks feel safe in the world.Help. I can’t make anyone else feel anything but I can help.Geeks. I speak first to people like me, geeks, who care about mechanisms & puzzles & surprising ideas.Feel. Living in my head most of the time divorced me from my emotions, which came back to bite me later. Hard. So I talk about emotions but also ideas from the perspective of how they affect & are affected by feelings.Safe. I often feel unsafe in situations where I’m perfectly safe, like a cocktail party. Sometimes I feel safe in situations where I’m acting unsafe, like pushing code that will break the system. I want my feelings of safety (or unsafety) to match the facts.In the world. Yes I talk about programming & software development, but I have learned my skills in the world at large contribute to my geeky pursuits & my geeky skills can contribute to the rest of my life.How Did I Discover My Mission?I looked at the things I had done in the first 2 decades of my career & asked what in the world tied together patterns, JUnit, TDD, & Extreme Programming? The phrase, helping geeks feel safe in the world, popped into my head.At first I thought what in the world does that mean? Then I realized that feeling safe when I was actually safe was a desperate wish of mine. I was beset by anxiety at the time. Each of the projects above increased safety:Patterns—Design discussions that are more likely to result in shared understanding & agreement.JUnit—Does this code work? The answer is a button press away. (I used to press the button 2 or 3 times if I really needed reassurance.)TDD—Do I know what the code is supposed to do? If I’m under time pressure, how will I know the code works?Extreme Programming—A whole set of safety-enhanced personal interactions.Why A Newsletter with Paying Subscribers?I needed new incentives. I started working actively on software design in 2005, although my interest went back to the 80s. You’ll notice that’s quite a while ago. I just wasn’t writing. What’s going to get me over my inertia?Turns out, the answer is “$7/month”. When I see a new subscriber, I want to deliver them something worthwhile. When I lose a subscriber, oh my, I want to deliver something valuable.With paying subscribers I don’t take my readers’ interest for granted. This leads me to take my responsibility to communicate more seriously.I expected a few friends-and-family to sign up. That would have been enough to keep me writing. I was shocked to discover that paying subscribers could actually free up my time to think & write more. And the ceiling is much higher—paying subscribers potentially could fund my retirement. But I’m going to need to keep creating value for that to happen.Why subscribe?I asked this question when I got to hundreds of paying subscribers. The answers clustered around:Gratitude for ideas I’ve contributed to in the past.Gratitude & encouragement for the ideas I’m working on now.With the help of a business coach, I acknowledged just how much gratitude I feel for the freedom my paying subscribers afford me. In return, I began publishing Thinkies, habits of creative thought. You’ll get one every Tuesday.Thinkies resulted from my introspection on ideas of mine that other people label “creative”. I noticed that most of my ideas result from identifiable habits of thinking, not from some mysterious tap on the forehead from a Muse.Ordinarily I wouldn’t publish a project this early, but I wanted to express my gratitude to my paying subscribers. I began publishing something unique. I like the idea that I can identify the first thousand people to hear about one of my ideas. The conversation around each Thinkie has been amazing.The other content for paying subscribers is fully drafted chapters from my books on software design. Since the first book is done & I haven’t started the second, there aren’t any of these at the moment.Join the crewBe part of a community of people who care about the hard questions of software design:When?Why?How much?Who?And most importantly:How’s that feel?To find out more about the author visit KentBeck.com.",

But it is a question I have to decide the answer to.I am adding indexOf() and lastIndexOf() operations to the Calculate transform of my data wrangling (ETL) software (Easy Data Transform). This will allow users to find the offset of one string inside another, counting from the start or the end of the string. Easy Data Transform is written in C++ and uses the Qt QString class for strings. There are indexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods for QString, so I thought this would be an easy job to wrap that functionality. Maybe 15 minutes to program it, write a test case and document it. Obviously it wasn’t that easy, otherwise I couldn’t be writing this blog post.Javascript disagrees with C++ QString and Excel on whether the first index of an empty string in an empty string is valid. Javascript disagrees with C++ QString on whether the last index of an empty string in a non-empty string is the index of the last character or 1 after the last character.C++ QString thinks the first index of an empty string in an empty string is the first character, but the last index of an empty string in an empty string is invalid.",

Back then, the number of useful devices running embedded Linux was rather small, and this was a standout. Back then, getting a hacker device that wasn’t a full-fledged computer onto a WiFi network was also fairly difficult. This one, relatively inexpensive WiFi router got you both in one box, so it was no surprise that we saw rovers with WRT54Gs as their brains, among other projects.Of course, some people just wanted a better router, and thus the OpenWRT project was born as a minimal Linux system that let you do fancy stuff with the stock router. Years passed, and OpenWRT was ported to newer routers, and features were added. Software grew, and as far as we know, current versions won’t even run on the minuscule RAM of the original hardware that gave it it’s name.Enter the ironic proposal that OpenWRT – the free software group that developed their code on a long-gone purple box – is developing their own hardware. Normally, we think of the development flow going the other way, right? But there’s a certain logic here as well. The software stack is now tried-and-true. They’ve got brand recognition, at least within the Hackaday universe. And in comparison, developing some known-good hardware to work with it is relatively easy.",
