According to Wikipedia, fashion accessories can be loosely categorized into two general areas: carried accessories and worn accessories.  Carried accessories include purses and handbags, hand fans, parasols and umbrellas, wallets, canes, and ceremonial swords.  Worn accessories include cravats, ties, hats, bonnets, belts and suspenders, gloves, muffs, necklaces, bracelets, watches, eyewear, sashes, shawls, scarves, lanyards, socks, pins, piercings, rings, and stockings.  Don’t ask me how I know this, but in order to wear stockings with a garter belt, you need to put your stockings on, then attach your garter belt to the stockings first, then pull up the belt and stockings like a pair of pantyhose.  Former NFL quarterback Joe Namath wore panty hose, but they don’t look good on just anyone, as you need to have the legs to make them look good.  This was a rather embarrassing commercial, but people will do anything to make money.  It is not clear to me if the hijab is or isn’t a fashion accessory, as it now comes in different colors, styles, designs, and materials with designers pushing the boundaries to make it something more than just a religious garment.Last week we had Gone But Not Forgotten where the theme was to find a song by an artist or songwriter that passed away in 2023.  This week the theme is to find a song that mentions clothing accessories suggested by Christine of Stine Writing and Miniatures.  Take some time to read the posts of other bloggers who respond to this music challenge, and even better, read as many of them as you can as you will probably find many enjoyable songs and it is quite possibly that you will learn a thing or two.  Share your music with others and post a video, try do some research and let everyone know something about the song that you post.  Tell everyone why you like the song, whether it was a hit, or what you think the song is about.  Show the lyrics, let’s all listen to our favorite songs and explore some new music.  Try to find a song that fits the theme, then write your post and create a pingback, or you can just place your link in the comments section.Suggestions• Try to use the prompt words or at least conform to a general theme, as you see it.  If the song you select does not meet the criteria, then please explain why you chose this song.• It would be good if you could post the lyrics to the song of your choice, as this is helpful for the people that want to follow along with the music.• Please try to include the songwriter(s) – it’s a good idea to give credit where credit is due. It would also be a good idea to give credit to the singer and the band associated with your song.• Your post can be as long or as short as you want it to be, but please try not to include too many videos as that just makes it take longer to look at all of the other posts.• Link to the YouTube video, or you can pull it into your post, so others can listen to the song.• Ping back to this post or place your link in the comments section below.• Read at least one other person’s blog, so we can all share new and fantastic music and create amazing new blogging friends in the process.• Feel free to suggest future prompts.• Have fun and enjoy the music.",
