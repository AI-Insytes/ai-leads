I’m going grey, dress like a slob, and dislike housework as much as anyone. I’m distinctly average. But I’m also hard core; for the following reasons…I experienced induction with almost no pain relief When I went into labour with large boy, he played silly buggers and I ended up getting induced. You can read the full story in Planning a birth plan, or not on the Procrastinating Mum blog where I told Lisa all about it. The essentials are that after 3 days on labour ward, I was induced with a syntocinon drip. Anyone who’s been induced knows that the contractions are intense. I dealt with them for the whole of labour, from barely effaced to fully dilated and pushing, all with just a TENS machine and gas and air.

Wilson said he couldn't comment on the Switch 2, but said that improved technical capabilities will be a bonus to EA software developers who have had to finely optimise their games to run on the current Nintendo Switch system. ‘I can absolutely not comment on anything that has not been announced, or acknowledge it in any way,’ Wilson replied.‘What I would say, however, is, to the extent that platforms over the course of the last 20 years [have] offered improved CPU, GPU, memory, battery life, screen resolution… to the extent that those things have happened, where we’re able to deliver more immersion for our players, particularly around our biggest franchises like FC, like Madden, like Apex, like Battlefield, that has typically been very good for our business. Our players’ ability to really experience our games at the highest level has typically worked out very well for us.’",

Polly had one classroom of children from age 4 to first grade.  Thank you, Barb.Barb TaubMy children have had several wonderful teachers, but the one who was absolutely life-changing was Polly. Their school went from age 4 to first grade. All in one classroom, with the children learning from each other. She didn’t teach any of them to read or to write. They instantly became readers, and they taught each other to write. Polly saw her role as being the one who arranged for each and every child to do the things they most wanted to do. She said anyone could be a good teacher, but to be a great one they needed to have passion about something in their lives. She herself had been a dancer, and that was the passion she drew upon.",

I was in contact with 30 companies, got a no from 8 companies, no reply from 6 companies, and offers from 3 companies. Here is what I learnt from the process.Laid OffAt the end of October last year, I lost my job. I was completely surprised, but in retrospect, maybe I shouldn’t have been that surprised. The times were getting tougher, and many companies had been laying off people during all of 2023. If the company is not making enough money, eventually there will be layoffs. In my case, we were 17 people let go that day, including 8 developers.A few minutes after I had the Zoom call with the CEO, my access to all company resources was cut off. Apart from not being able to finish what I was working on (I had several unpushed changes), it becomes harder to say goodbye to everybody. Many of my colleagues reached out on LinkedIn, which was great. Some even set up Zoom calls so we could talk about what had happened, and say a proper goodbye, which I really appreciated.Finding RolesLinkedInOther SourcesApplying and TrackingTools I Paid ForReflectionsThe Interview ProcessPreparationsInterviewsCoding TestsSalaryChoosingLessons LearnedConclusion",

        "context": "Throughout the last few years’ time, I’ve been seeing sparks of an eternal discussion here and there. It’s a nuanced one, but if I could summarize, it’s about different feature development strategies we can follow to design things, especially if they’re aimed at a larger market. Specifically – when adding a feature, how complete and perfect should it be?A while back, I read a Mastodon thread about VLC not implementing backwards per-frame skipping. At the surface level, it’s about an indignant user asking – what’s the deal with VLC not having a “go back a frame” button? A ton of video players have this feature implemented. There’s a forum thread linked, and, reading it could leave you with a good few conflicting emotions. Here’s a recap.In what appears to be one of multiple threads asking about a ‘previous frame’ button in VLC, there’s an 82-post discussion involving multiple different VLC developers. The users’ argument is that it appears to be clearly technically possible to add a ‘previous frame’ button in practice, and the developers’ argument is that it’s technologically complex to implement in some cases – for certain formats, even impossible to implement! Let’s go into the developers’ stated reasoning in more details, then – here’s what you can find in the thread, to the best of my ability.The Mess Of Video Formats And Human EmotionsOf course, it’s foolish to conclude that if some people are going over the line, their core argument is invalid. On the other hand, it doesn’t make for a pleasant atmosphere, and the reality of human condition will mean that the negative aspects of this discussion will make any work on such a feature an increasingly unpleasant experience for VLC developers. If they implement it now in some form, expect it to be a chorus of “told ya so”, which is hardly ever positive motivation.Perfection Isn’t A VirtueOne of the developers’ core arguments is that the feature can’t work perfectly in all cases. The problem is that nobody was asking for perfection. If the developers’ responses are focused on how a feature can’t be implemented perfectly but the users in question aren’t asking for a perfect implementation, maybe the developers are approaching this feature from a fundamentally wrong angle.Bridging The Gap",
