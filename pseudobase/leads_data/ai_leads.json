By harnessing the power of advanced algorithms, AI can rapidly generate compelling blog posts on a diverse range of topics, tailored to specific audiences. Moreover, it can analyze trends and audience engagement to optimize content, enhancing its impact. While AI streamlines the writing process, it also empowers human creators by providing valuable insights and freeing up time for strategic thinking and ideation. Embracing AI in blog writing opens up exciting possibilities for innovation and scalability in the ever-evolving digital landscape.",

On the other hand, I’m limited as to what I can do with this version of the Classic.I’ve been wondering if I should focus my marketing efforts on TikTok and Instagram. I haven’t explored these platforms before and I have to admit I find them daunting. The videos I’ve seen on TikTok are all so fast – fast edits, and people talking at 90 miles an hour.

Who knew?” I blog exclusively from my iPhone and the Jetpack iPhone app on iOS does not have an AI Assistant block. So I did something I rarely do. I opened up wordpress.com on my Safari browser on my iPhone. Once there, I decided to create a new post using the block editor (because on the iOS app, the block editor is all that’s available).When I went to create a new post, I was asked to select the block I wanted to start my new post with. I tapped the plus sign and it gave me a bunch of commonly used blocks, but there was no AI Assistant block shown. So I went to the search box and typed “AI Assistant” in it.

        "context": "In the world of digital art, distinguishing between AI-generated and human-made creations has become a significant challenge. Almost overnight, tool sets for generating AI artworks became commonly available to the public, and suddenly, every digital art competition had to contend with potential submissions. Some have welcomed AI, while others demand competitors create artworks by their own hand and no other.The problem facing artists and judges alike is just how to determine whether an artwork was created by a human or an AI. So what can be done?Put It To The TestFirst of all, it’s crucial to understand what AI art generators can and cannot do. These algorithms, often trained on vast datasets of human-made art, excel in pattern recognition and replication. However, they typically struggle with conceptual depth and the nuanced, often irregular, elements that human creativity can produce. They’re great at mashing up weird combinations, like creating a cartoon picture of cats surfing off the coast of Neo-Hawaii, for example.Case StudyFor digital artist [Mizkai], this problem has already become very real. [Mizkai] entered an illustration contest in October, penning a Halloween scene with a young witch. After submission though, things went awry. “At first they said they suspected I had traced AI work as my style was inconsistent,” [Mizkai] told Hackaday. Trying to rectify the issue in good faith, [Mizkai] elected to try and sort the problem out with the competition organizers. “I said I’m happy to cooperate and provide them with evidence,” says [Mizkai], noting that she provided an original Photoshop file with layers intact, indicating she’d created the piece from scratch. When that wasn’t enough, [Mizkai] provided a range of other artworks including pencil drawings and inked pieces to bear out her case that she was indeed a real artist. When that wasn’t enough, she stepped up to providing time lapse videos of character sketches to show her technique.https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/10000000_24639141735677291_2149074033395101145_n.mp4",
