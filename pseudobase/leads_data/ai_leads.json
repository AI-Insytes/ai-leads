An AI image generator allows the user to input information the user wishes to see in an image. For instance, if you have an idea for a character in your next novel or short story, you can enter a description of said character, and just like that, you’re looking at your character!",

Almost overnight, tool sets for generating AI artworks became commonly available to the public, and suddenly, every digital art competition had to contend with potential submissions. Some have welcomed AI, while others demand competitors create artworks by their own hand and no other.The problem facing artists and judges alike is just how to determine whether an artwork was created by a human or an AI. So what can be done?Put It To The TestFirst of all, it’s crucial to understand what AI art generators can and cannot do. These algorithms, often trained on vast datasets of human-made art, excel in pattern recognition and replication. However, they typically struggle with conceptual depth and the nuanced, often irregular, elements that human creativity can produce. They’re great at mashing up weird combinations, like creating a cartoon picture of cats surfing off the coast of Neo-Hawaii, for example.Case StudyFor digital artist [Mizkai], this problem has already become very real. [Mizkai] entered an illustration contest in October, penning a Halloween scene with a young witch. After submission though, things went awry. “At first they said they suspected I had traced AI work as my style was inconsistent,” [Mizkai] told Hackaday. Trying to rectify the issue in good faith, [Mizkai] elected to try and sort the problem out with the competition organizers. “I said I’m happy to cooperate and provide them with evidence,” says [Mizkai], noting that she provided an original Photoshop file with layers intact, indicating she’d created the piece from scratch. When that wasn’t enough, [Mizkai] provided a range of other artworks including pencil drawings and inked pieces to bear out her case that she was indeed a real artist. When that wasn’t enough, she stepped up to providing time lapse videos of character sketches to show her technique.https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/10000000_24639141735677291_2149074033395101145_n.mp4",
