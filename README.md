## Lead Generation App MVP

An app to assist with finding people of interest:

* User input (to command line)
* Stretch: Generate top keywords for the target via AI
* Search capability based on user input of the internet or specific app [LinkedIn public profiles]
* Database storage of results
  * Name
  * Relevant information about person/company
  * Way to find them LinkedIn profile link (public)
* AI generated messaging suggested to user
  * Based on information gathered from search  
  * limited by specified length

***Pain Points:***

* Eases the difficulty of reaching the “early adopters” (first people interested in buying the product) in early stage of business growth
* Reduces time for each outreach
