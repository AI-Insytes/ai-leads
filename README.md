## Lead Generation App MVP 

An app to assist with finding people of interest: 

* User input (to command line)
    * Stretch: Generate top keywords for the target via AI
* Search capability based on user input of the internet or specific app [LinkedIn public profiles]
* Database storage of results
    * Name
    * Relevant information about person/company
    * Way to find them [LinkedIn profile link (public)]
* AI generated messaging suggested to user 
    * Based on information gathered from search  
    * limited by specified length

Pain Points: 

* Eases the difficulty of reaching the “early adopters” (first people interested in buying the product) in early stage of business growth
* Reduces time for each outreach
