Boyack has written a few posts about AI. You can find one of those posts here: POSTSo, what exactly is an AI image generator, and how can an author put such a thing to good use? An AI image generator allows the user to input information the user wishes to see in an image. For instance, if you have an idea for a character in your next novel or short story, you can enter a description of said character, and just like that, you’re looking at your character!"

At the moment I’m using a workaround version of the Classic editor, as I have serious issues with the Block editor – it’s difficult to use without the ‘free’ plugins, which you can only have if you get the paid version of WordPress, which I can’t afford. On the other hand, I’m limited as to what I can do with this version of the Classic.I’ve been wondering if I should focus my marketing efforts on TikTok and Instagram. I haven’t explored these platforms before and I have to admit I find them daunting. The videos I’ve seen on TikTok are all so fast – fast edits, and people talking at 90 miles an hour. I’ll have to up my game if I’m not going to come across as a total amateur, and I’ll have to have something to say."

context,"In the world of digital art, distinguishing between AI-generated and human-made creations has become a significant challenge. Almost overnight, tool sets for generating AI artworks became commonly available to the public, and suddenly, every digital art competition had to contend with potential submissions. Some have welcomed AI, while others demand competitors create artworks by their own hand and no other.The problem facing artists and judges alike is just how to determine whether an artwork was created by a human or an AI. So what can be done?Put It To The TestFirst of all, it’s crucial to understand what AI art generators can and cannot do. These algorithms, often trained on vast datasets of human-made art, excel in pattern recognition and replication. However, they typically struggle with conceptual depth and the nuanced, often irregular, elements that human creativity can produce. They’re great at mashing up weird combinations, like creating a cartoon picture of cats surfing off the coast of Neo-Hawaii, for example.Case StudyFor digital artist [Mizkai], this problem has already become very real. [Mizkai] entered an illustration contest in October, penning a Halloween scene with a young witch. After submission though, things went awry. “At first they said they suspected I had traced AI work as my style was inconsistent,” [Mizkai] told Hackaday. Trying to rectify the issue in good faith, [Mizkai] elected to try and sort the problem out with the competition organizers. “I said I’m happy to cooperate and provide them with evidence,” says [Mizkai], noting that she provided an original Photoshop file with layers intact, indicating she’d created the piece from scratch. When that wasn’t enough, [Mizkai] provided a range of other artworks including pencil drawings and inked pieces to bear out her case that she was indeed a real artist. When that wasn’t enough, she stepped up to providing time lapse videos of character sketches to show her technique.https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/10000000_24639141735677291_2149074033395101145_n.mp4"

One of her questions was “Have you tried out the AI assistant in WP?”My first reaction to that question was, “WordPress has an AI Assistant? Who knew?” I blog exclusively from my iPhone and the Jetpack iPhone app on iOS does not have an AI Assistant block. So I did something I rarely do. I opened up wordpress.com on my Safari browser on my iPhone. Once there, I decided to create a new post using the block editor (because on the iOS app, the block editor is all that’s available).When I went to create a new post, I was asked to select the block I wanted to start my new post with. I tapped the plus sign and it gave me a bunch of commonly used blocks, but there was no AI Assistant block shown. So I went to the search box and typed “AI Assistant” in it.

context,"WordPress.com let us know via email last night that there is now an AI Assistant available in the blog post editor. At least if you are using the Block Editor format. I don’t know if it’s there if you’re writing HTML code or anything else, but if you’re using blocks you can add an AI Assistant block and ask it to do stuff for you. For example, I asked the AI Assistant to write a paragraph about using AI to write a blog post and it came up with this absolute fucking masterpiece:AI has revolutionized the way we approach content creation, offering unprecedented efficiency and creativity. By harnessing the power of advanced algorithms, AI can rapidly generate compelling blog posts on a diverse range of topics, tailored to specific audiences. Moreover, it can analyze trends and audience engagement to optimize content, enhancing its impact. While AI streamlines the writing process, it also empowers human creators by providing valuable insights and freeing up time for strategic thinking and ideation. Embracing AI in blog writing opens up exciting possibilities for innovation and scalability in the ever-evolving digital landscape."

One thing that never fails to impress me is how versatile they are, as they can be used for so many different needs and purposes.For example, I have been working on a series of posts that explain to people how to use Amazon ads. Doing this helped me realize that AI tools are perfect for educative purposes – from teaching marketing to helping students learn English as a foreign language.Here are some of the many ways I can think of in which AI tools can be used in education.AI can speed up research assistanceAI grammar checkers can teach grammatical concepts and correct errorsAI tools can offer analytics and feedbackAI paraphrasers can help in vocabulary buildingPlagiarism CheckAI summarizers can help in condensing information and making it more understandableSome Do’s and Don’ts of Using AI Tools for Educative Purposes"

context,"When I noticed some electric wiring running from the power socket in the kitchen to the sink half filled with soapy water, I knew that my robot was up to no good.I know I’d crossed IT several times (I am not an IT; use my proper pronoun). All I did was point out that when IT moved the sofa to vacuum underneath IT never put it back to its exact original position. There are marks in the carpet where it normally sits. Just push it back to there. Did my request cause a stir or what? All the armchairs from then on were “mispositioned”. Cutlery in the kitchen drawers were “rearranged”. The table was set with the wrong dishes. The list was interminable. I said to my husband that we have to get rid of that THING. (I am not a THING; use my proper pronoun).It was after that I saw the electric wiring in the kitchen sink. My husband phoned the psychiatric services (for me, not the robot). They arrived and called the police. Apparently I was trying to electrocute my husband. I was the one who had set it up."
